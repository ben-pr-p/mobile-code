# flockcode — Agent Guide

A React Native (Expo) mobile client for [opencode](https://github.com/sst/opencode), the AI coding agent. Voice-first interface for interacting with the opencode agent away from the keyboard.

## Stack

- **React Native** 0.81 via **Expo** 54
- **NativeWind** (Tailwind CSS for React Native) for styling
- **React Native Reanimated** 4 for animations
- **TypeScript** 5.9
- **Bun** as the package manager and runtime

## Commands

```sh
bun install          # install dependencies
bun run start        # start Expo dev server
bun run ios          # run on iOS simulator
bun run lint         # eslint + prettier check
bun run format       # eslint --fix + prettier --write
```

## Platform

**iOS only** — no Android support. Do not add Android-specific code or configurations.

## Code Style Notes

- Use `/** ... */` JSDoc comments for exported components and other exported APIs that should be discoverable in IntelliSense.
- Keep multiline export docs near the exported declaration for discoverability in IntelliSense.
- Use `//` comments only for inline implementation notes inside function bodies.

## Simulator Screenshots with Maestro

Use [Maestro](https://maestro.mobile.dev/) to take screenshots of the running iOS simulator and interact with the app. The app must already be running in the simulator (`bun run ios`).

To run maestro commands, always set the Java environment:

```sh
JAVA_HOME=/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/bin:$PATH:$HOME/.maestro/bin" MAESTRO_CLI_NO_ANALYTICS=1 MAESTRO_CLI_ANALYSIS_NOTIFICATION_DISABLED=true maestro test <flow.yaml>
```

### Quick screenshot

Run the existing flow to capture the current screen:

```sh
maestro test .maestro/screenshot.yaml
```

Then read `.maestro/screenshots/latest.png` to view it.

### Writing custom flows

Create a `.yaml` file in `.maestro/` with steps. Common commands:

```yaml
appId: host.exp.Exponent
---
- launchApp
- waitForAnimationToEnd
- tapOn: "Settings"              # tap on visible text
- tapOn:
    id: "my-test-id"            # tap by testID
- scrollDown
- assertVisible: "Some Text"
- takeScreenshot: .maestro/screenshots/my-screenshot
```

See [Maestro docs](https://maestro.mobile.dev/reference/commands) for the full command reference.

### Tips

- `appId: host.exp.Exponent` is for Expo Go. After `expo prebuild`, use the app's bundle ID instead.
- Use `testID` props on React Native components so Maestro can find them by `id`.
- Screenshots are saved as PNG. Use the `Read` tool to view them.

## Requirements & Design Docs

**Start with `docs/requirements.md`** — it documents all screens, voice input modes, offline behavior, and iPad layout adaptations derived from the Pencil design files.

For more specific or visual information beyond what's in `requirements.md`, the source designs are `.pen` files in `docs/designs/`. These require the **Pencil MCP tool** to read — do not attempt to read them as text files.

### Getting screenshots from design files

If you have access to the Pencil MCP tools, you can get screenshots of any frame:

1. Use `get_editor_state()` to see what file is open and what frames exist.
2. Use `batch_get(filePath, patterns=[{type: "frame"}], searchDepth=1)` to list all top-level frames and their IDs.
3. Use `get_screenshot(filePath, nodeId)` to render any frame as an image.

Key frames in `iphone.pen`:
- `DBiql` — Left Sidebar (Sessions)
- `rHaLS` — Main Session
- `Sur5f` — Right Sidebar (Projects)
- `6bCVL` — Right Sidebar (Projects, many)
- `ZmX9L` — Settings
- `Rni86`–`RwGZZ` — Hold Flow steps 1–5
- `Z1OQW`–`D3SZy` — Hands-Free Flow steps 1–5
- `72Eft`–`M2Qrh` — Auto-Record Flow steps 1–5

Key frames in `ipad-min-landscape.pen`:
- `P2k55` — Sessions List + Chat
- `4bcIL` — Session + Changes (diff view)
- `nDkEl` — Shell Detail + Chat
- `ocVmr` — Agent Detail + Chat
- `yD3eW` — Settings
- `vRGg5` — Projects
- `oYSZr`–`bnq9a` — Hold Flow steps 1–5
- `zgVJR`–`6FkbC` — Hands-Free Flow steps 1–5
- `cuzrC`–`VdcFV` — Auto-Record Flow steps 1–5
